* `wine` removed. We really wanted to keep it around, but so far we had more issues with `wine` than we had with any other tool..
  We decided to remove it for now as it breaks the install/provision process - if the new Xcode 8 (beta) is installed on the system
  `wine` fails to install.

  to not to duplicate tasks/scripts between the initial setup and the weekly cache updates.
